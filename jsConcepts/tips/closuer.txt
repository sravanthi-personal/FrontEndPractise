A closures is a mechanism that allows the inner function to remember the 
outer scope variables when it was defined, even after the outer function has returned. 

The closure has three scope chains :

1) It can access its own scope means variables defined between its curly brackets({}).
2) It can access the outer function's variables.
3) It can access the global variables. 

const outer = () => {
    var message = "I am outside";
    const inner = () => {
        console.log(message);
    };
    return inner;
};

const innerFunc = outer();
innerFunc();
